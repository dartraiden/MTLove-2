MTLove_UI_Localization	= "default";

--[[ ID's:
	"default"		-> the local-ID from your client
	"enUS"/"enGB"	-> english
	"deDE"			-> german
	"ruRU"			-> russian

	If here is no localization for your language or its is
	outdated and disabled and you want add or update it,
	create an issue on https://github.com/dartraiden/MTLove-2/issues.
	Thanks
